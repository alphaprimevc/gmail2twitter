gmail2twitter
=============

Tweet and retweet emails sent to a gmail account.

    bundle exec ruby init.rb config.yml

(you probably want to put this up on a server and cron it)

Be sure to put the url you want to share in the body of the email. The email subject will be used as text for your tweet.
